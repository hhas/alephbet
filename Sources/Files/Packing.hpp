/*
 *  Basic packing and unpacking routines. These are used because the Marathon
 *  series has used packed big-endian data formats, while internally, data is
 *  most efficiently accessed if it has native alignments, which often involve
 *  compiler-generated padding. Furthermore, the data may internally be little-
 *  endian instead of big-endian.
 *
 *  The packed form of the data is a simple stream of bytes, and as the
 *  routines run, they advance the stream pointer appropriately. So be sure to
 *  keep a copy of an object's base pointer when using these routines.
 *
 *  The syntax was chosen to make it easy to create an unpacking version of a
 *  packing routine, by simply changing the routine names.
 *
 *  StreamToValue(uint8* &Stream, T& Number)
 *      unpacks a stream into a numerical value (T is int16, uint16, int32,
 *      uint32)
 *
 *  ValueToStream(uint8* &Stream, T Number)
 *      packs a numerical value (T is int16, uint16, int32, uint32) into a
 *      stream
 *
 *  StreamToList(uint8* &Stream, T* List, size_t Count)
 *      unpacks a stream into a list of numerical values (T is int16, uint16,
 *      int32, uint32)
 *
 *  ListToStream(uint8* &Stream, const T* List, size_t Count)
 *      packs a list of numerical values (T is int16, uint16, int32, uint32)
 *      into a stream
 *
 *  StreamToBytes(uint8* &Stream, void* Bytes, size_t Count)
 *      unpacks a stream into a block of bytes
 *
 *  BytesToStream(uint8* &Stream, const void* Bytes, size_t Count)
 *      packs a block of bytes into a stream
